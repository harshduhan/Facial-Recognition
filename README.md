# Facial-Recognition

Problem Statement: To build a system that enables teachers to mark attendance in an efficient manner keeping in mind the wake of covid-19.

Suggested solution: The creation of a facial recognition attendance system that simultaneously checks if the person is wearing a mask or not. This project would benefit teachers as the attendance will be marked remotely making sure that there are no errors during this process. The application marks attendance on a CSV file by using special modules and automatic facial recognition.
Another feature of the application is that it informs the user whether they are wearing a mask or not, it further displays a message regarding the entry of the person depending on the recognition of the face mask. This feature helps implement covid-19 safety protocols. 

Intro: In the year 2019 schools, colleges and offices were forced to go into a lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After two years physical schools are slowly opening up. According to government guidelines students have to wear masks and are requested to come into batches. It is also error-prone, where a student can be marked present more than once or be accidentally marked absent. Further, it will be a task to check for the masks.
